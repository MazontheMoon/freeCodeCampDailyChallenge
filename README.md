### 12 - Too Much Screen TIme
Given an input array of seven integers, representing a week's time, where each integer is the amount of hours spent on your phone that day, determine if it is too much screen time based on these constraints:

- If any single day has 10 hours or more, it's too much.
- If the average of any three days in a row is greater than or equal to 8 hours, itâ€™s too much.
- If the average of the seven days is greater than or equal to 6 hours, it's too much.

### 13 - Missing Numbers
Given an array of integers from 1 to n, inclusive, return an array of all the missing integers between 1 and n (where n is the largest number in the given array).

- The given array may be unsorted and may contain duplicates.
- The returned array should be in ascending order.
- If no integers are missing, return an empty array.

### 14 - Word Frequency
Given a paragraph, return an array of the three most frequently occurring words.

- Words in the paragraph will be separated by spaces.
- Ignore case in the given paragraph. For example, treat Hello and hello as the same word.
- Ignore punctuation in the given paragraph. Punctuation consists of commas (,), periods (.), and exclamation points (!).
- The returned array should have all lowercase words.
- The returned array should be in descending order with the most frequently occurring word first.

### 15 - Thermostat Adjuster
Given the current temperature of a room and a target temperature, return a string indicating how to adjust the room temperature based on these constraints:

- Return "heat" if the current temperature is below the target.
- Return "cool" if the current temperature is above the target.
- Return "hold" if the current temperature is equal to the target.
