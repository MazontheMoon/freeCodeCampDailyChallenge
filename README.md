### 1 - Tribonacci Sequence
The Tribonacci sequence is a series of numbers where each number is the sum of the three preceding ones. When starting with 0, 0 and 1, the first 10 numbers in the sequence are 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 4, 7, 13, 24, 44.

Given an array containing the first three numbers of a Tribonacci sequence, and an integer representing the length of the sequence, return an array containing the sequence of the given length.
- Your function should handle sequences of any length greater than or equal to zero.
- If the length is zero, return an empty array.
- Note that the starting numbers are part of the sequence.

### 2 - RGB to Hex
Given a CSS rgb(r, g, b) color string, return its hexadecimal equivalent.
- Make any letters lowercase.
- Return a # followed by six characters. Don't use any shorthand values.

### 3 - Pangram
Given a word or sentence and a string of lowercase letters, determine if the word or sentence uses all the letters from the given set at least once and no other letters.
- Ignore non-alphabetical characters in the word or sentence.
- Ignore letter casing in the word or sentence.

### 4 - Vowel Repeater
Given a string, return a new version of the string where each vowel is duplicated one more time than the previous vowel you encountered. For instance, the first vowel in the sentence should remain unchanged. The second vowel should appear twice in a row. The third vowel should appear three times in a row, and so on.
- The letters a, e, i, o, and u, in either uppercase or lowercase, are considered vowels.
- The original vowel should keeps its case.

- It does not have leading zeros (e.g. 0 is allowed, 01 is not).
- Only numeric characters are allowed.

### 6 - Matrix Rotate
Given a matrix (an array of arrays), rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise and return it. For instance, given [[1, 2], [3, 4]], which looks like this:

1	2

You should return [[3, 1], [4, 2]], which looks like this:

3	1
4	2
